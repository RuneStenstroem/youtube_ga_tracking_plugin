# Youtube Google Analytics tracking plugin for WordPress
Version 1.0
Tested with WordPress 4.6.
A small WordPress plugin which allows you to track Youtube videos in Google Analytics. It is required that you have inserted your GA UA tacking code on your site. If you want a plugin for inserting the code you can use this one:

With the plugin you embed Youtube videos with the following shortcode:

[youtube-video id="ID of video(the last part of the url)"]

Example:

[youtube-video id="oHg5SJYRHA0"]

In Google Analytics you can go to events and see how many times your videos have been played, paused and ended. So it gives an indication of how many times users watch a whole video and so on.
